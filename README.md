## Executive Summary

Findings indicate steady growth in revenue and orders with a peak in November 2017(__), before plateauing at around February 2018. The best overall performing categories are bed, table and bath; computer accessories and beauty/health. Most customers are based in the three biggest states, Rio de Janeiro(13%), Minas Gerais (11%) and SÃ£o paulo (38%). Furthermore, following states order patterns shows that many of the highest purchasing states spend less on average per order while the inverse happens the lowest purchasing states. Moreover, there is also a correlation between delivery times as the states that order the most spend the least on shipping costs and have the fastest delivery times again the inverse happens. 

Freight/shipping prices had a significant rise after February 2018 peaking at __ in $22.95 in July of that year. This rise also occurred during the revenue plateau, suggesting correlation between the two factors. In fact, we can see by the line chart that payments made by credit card really took the majority place on brazilian e-commerce. Besides that, from 201803 it's possible to see a little decrease in this type of payment. By the other hand, payments made by debit card are showing a growing trend since 201805, which is a good opportunity for investors to improve services for payments like this.
On the bar chart above, we can see how Brazilian customers prefer to pay the orders: mostly of them pay once into 1 installment and it's worth pointing out the quantity of payments done by 10 installments.

### Customers
An average monetary customer is $136 and 75% of the customers spend less than $150 and the maximum was $4690. Furthermore, the average customer spends $136 and 75% spend less than $150. Only 3% of customers purchased more than once. Most customers are located on the east coast, in cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Not only is this where most of the population live but these areas have the fastest shipping and the lowest cost of shipping. This makes sense as these places have the most infrastructure. Furthermore, the low cost is enticing for people in this region. However, there is untapped potential in the country north-east with areas such as Ceara, Pernambuco and Para as these areas have a low amount of orders compared to their population.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the [stakeholder team] to consider the following:
Focus on pushing products in categories that showed high growth such as construction tools, pets and bedroom furniture. This will help to grow revenue and would enable the company to enhance its overall performance and mitigate potential risks in the market.
Expand into the underperforming regions of Ceara, Pernambuco and Para to increase customer base. 
Only 3% of customers are repeat customers. Improving this number is crucial to making revenue more stable. Offer more deals and advertise sales to previous customers to retain sales.
Consider promotion at busy times such as holiday period and black Friday to increase volume or launch new products.

## Assumptions and Caveats
Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:
Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)


Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)


Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
